\usage{
pvalr(pvals, sig.limit = .001, digits = 3, html = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pvals}{numeric value or vector of p-values}

\item{sig.limit}{lower bound for precision}

\item{digits}{integer; number of decimal places; see also
\code{\link[rawr]{roundr}}}

\item{html}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, uses \code{&lt;} instead of \code{<}}
}
\description{
Formats several cases of p-values; see details
}
\details{
This function will deal with several cases of common p-values: 1) p-values
which are > 0.1 will be rounded to two decimal places (and keep any trailing
0s) since we are not usually interested in precision of insignificant
values; 2) p-values which are less than the specified \code{sig.level} will
be formatted as \code{< 0.001}, for example; 3) p-values that are less than
0.01 but greater than \code{sig.level} will be precise to \code{digits} and
keep any trailing 0s.

\examples{
pvals <- c(.13354, .060123, .004233, .00000016223)
